# **DevSecOps Pipeline Optimization**

This project focuses on step-by-step optimization of DevSecOps pipelines to enhance security, efficiency, and compliance by identifying and addressing gaps in tool usage and activity coverage.

## **Features**
1. **Tool Identification and Customization**:
   - Users can select tools for each pipeline stage.
   - An "Other" option allows manual entry of tools, which are temporarily stored for potential reuse.

2. **Activity Matching**:
   - Automatically maps tools to corresponding security activities.

3. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Identifies uncovered security activities and highlights areas requiring attention.

4. **Tool Suggestions**:
   - Recommends tools to address gaps, including descriptions and supported activities.
   - Users can decide which tools to implement.

5. **Policy-Based Activities**:
   - Identifies activities requiring procedural or policy-based implementations.

6. **Comprehensive Reporting**:
   - Generates reports with the following options:
     - Default Report: Standard summary of findings.
     - Full Report: Exhaustive details on tools, activities, and gaps.
     - Customized Report: User-selected fields for tailored reporting.

7. **Iterative Development**:
   - Agile methodology for continuous refinement of the pipeline.

## **Workflow Steps**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Populate the system with initial data (`dsomm.json`, `pipeline_order.json`, `tools.json`).

2. **Tool Selection**:
   - Users select tools for each pipeline stage or manually input new tools.

3. **Activity Matching**:
   - Map selected tools to supported security activities.

4. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Compare implemented activities against recommended ones to identify gaps.

5. **Tool Suggestions**:
   - Recommend additional tools to cover gaps and allow iterative refinement.

6. **Final Report**:
   - Generate a structured report summarizing:
     - Tools and activities for each pipeline stage.
     - Policy-based activities.
     - Unimplemented tools and their descriptions.
