# **Project Overview**

The project aims to assist clients in optimizing their DevSecOps pipelines by:

1. **Identifying Used Tools:** Prompting users to select the tools they currently employ at various pipeline stages.
2. **Matching Tools to Activities:** Linking selected tools to specific security activities they can perform.
3. **Conducting Gap Analysis:** Determining which recommended activities are not covered by the user's current toolset.
4. **Suggesting Tools for Gaps:** Recommending additional tools to bridge identified gaps, complete with brief descriptions and the activities they support.
5. **Generating a Summary Diagram:** Creating a structured text-based overview that outlines tools, their corresponding activities, associated risks, and measures, organized by pipeline stages.
6. **Listing Policy-Based Activities:** Highlighting activities that require procedural or policy implementations, independent of specific tools.

## **Workflow Overview**

1. **Data Initialization (Rare Operation):**
   - **Purpose:** Populate the system with initial data from JSON files.
   - **Process:**
     - Run `data_loader.py` to read `dsomm.json`, `pipeline_order.json`, and `tools.json`.
     - Insert data into appropriate data structures or, if integrated, into a database like MongoDB.
   - **Frequency:** Performed once during setup or when significant data updates are required.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - **Purpose:** Gather information about the tools currently in use by the client.
   - **Process:**
     - For each DevSecOps pipeline stage (as defined in `pipeline_order.json`), prompt the user to select from a list of available tools or choose "None".
     - Allow multiple selections per stage.
   - **Outcome:** A compiled list of tools selected by the user, organized by pipeline stages.

3. **Activity Matching:**
   - **Purpose:** Identify which security activities are covered by the user's selected tools.
   - **Process:**
     - Use `activity_matcher.py` to link each selected tool to its corresponding activities based on `dsomm.json`.
   - **Outcome:** A list of implemented activities, indicating coverage within the pipeline.

4. **Gap Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** Determine which recommended activities are not currently covered by the user's toolset.
   - **Process:**
     - Compare the list of implemented activities against the full set of recommended activities from `dsomm.json`.
     - Identify activities that are not covered—these represent the **gaps**.
   - **Outcome:** A clear understanding of which activities need to be addressed to enhance the security posture.

5. **Tool Suggestion for Gaps:**
   - **Purpose:** Provide actionable recommendations to bridge identified gaps.
   - **Process:**
     - For each uncovered activity, use `tool_suggester.py` to suggest tools that can perform the necessary activities.
     - Present these suggestions to the user, organized by pipeline stages, including brief descriptions and the specific activities each tool supports.
     - Allow the user to select additional tools or opt to skip.
   - **Outcome:** An updated list of tools that can help cover previously uncovered activities.

6. **Iterative Gap Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** Continuously refine the coverage of security activities as the user selects additional tools.
   - **Process:**
     - After each tool selection, re-run the gap analysis to identify any remaining uncovered activities.
     - Repeat the tool suggestion process until the user is satisfied with the coverage.
   - **Outcome:** Gradual closure of gaps, leading to a more secure and comprehensive pipeline.

7. **Final Report Generation:**
   - **Purpose:** Provide a structured summary of the user's tools, covered activities, and remaining policy-based activities.
   - **Process:**
     - Use `report_generator.py` to compile a textual diagram that includes:
       - **Per Pipeline Stage:**
         - Selected tools.
         - Activities each tool covers, along with descriptions, associated risks, and measures.
       - **Policy-Based Activities:**
         - Activities that are not tool-dependent and require procedural or policy implementations.
     - Output the diagram as a `.txt` file.
   - **Outcome:** A comprehensive report that serves as both documentation and a roadmap for enhancing the client's DevSecOps pipeline.

        - Example Prompt:  
          - *"Which tools do you use for CI/CD?"*  
            - Options: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, None.
      - **Outcome:** Collect user-selected tools organized by pipeline stages.
   
   c. **Match Tools to Activities:**
      - **Action:**  
        - Utilize `activity_matcher.py` to associate each selected tool with its respective security activities as defined in `dsomm.json`.
        - Example Mapping:  
          - *Jenkins* → Build Automation, Test Automation.
          - *OWASP ZAP* → Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
      - **Outcome:** Generate a list of implemented activities based on tool selections.
   
   d. **Perform Gap Analysis:**
      - **Action:**  
        - Use `gap_analyzer.py` to compare implemented activities against all recommended activities.
        - Identify activities that are not currently covered by the selected tools.
      - **Outcome:** Highlight gaps in the security activities coverage.
   
   e. **Suggest Tools for Identified Gaps:**
      - **Action:**  
        - For each uncovered activity, reference `tools.json` to find tools capable of performing the required activities.
        - Present these tool suggestions to the user, including:
          - **Tool Name**
          - **Brief Description**
          - **Activities It Can Perform**
        - Organize suggestions by pipeline stages.
        - Allow the user to select additional tools or choose "None" if they prefer not to implement certain activities.
      - **Outcome:** Update the list of selected tools based on user input.
   
   f. **Iterative Refinement:**
      - **Action:**  
        - After each round of tool suggestions and selections, re-run the gap analysis to identify any remaining uncovered activities.
        - Repeat the tool suggestion process until the user has addressed all desired gaps or opts to stop.
      - **Outcome:** Achieve optimal coverage of security activities through tool selection.
   
   g. **Generate Final Report:**
      - **Action:**  
        - Execute `report_generator.py` to compile the final summary, which includes:
          - **Per Pipeline Stage:**

## **Data Management**

### **1. Data Sources:**

- **`dsomm.json`:**  
  Contains comprehensive data on security activities, organized hierarchically by dimensions and sub-dimensions.

- **`pipeline_order.json`:**  
  Defines the sequence and dependencies of various DevSecOps pipeline stages (e.g., Version Control → CI/CD → Testing → Deployment).

- **`tools.json`:**  
  Details available tools, including their descriptions and the specific security activities they support.

### **2. Data Loading Process (`data_loader.py`):**

- **Purpose:**  
  Import data from the JSON files into the system's internal data structures or database collections.

- **Flow:**  
  1. **Read JSON Files:**  
     - Load data from `dsomm.json`, `pipeline_order.json`, and `tools.json`.
  
  2. **Transform Data:**  
     - Structure the data to align with the application's data models defined in `models.py`.
  
  3. **Insert Data:**  
     - Populate the corresponding modules or database collections with the transformed data.
  
- **Note:**  
  This process is decoupled from the main execution flow to ensure that data insertion does not interfere with regular operations.

## **User Interaction and Experience**

1. **Intuitive Prompts:**
   - Design user prompts to be clear and straightforward, guiding users through each pipeline stage without overwhelming them.
   - Example:  
     - *"Which tools do you currently use for Containerization?"*  
       - Options: Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, None.

2. **Flexible Responses:**
   - Allow multiple selections per stage to accommodate environments where multiple tools are used.
   - Provide an option to select "None" to account for scenarios where no tool is in use for a particular stage.

3. **Dynamic Suggestions:**
   - As gaps are identified, present tool suggestions relevant to those specific gaps, organized by the corresponding pipeline stage.
   - Include brief, informative descriptions to aid users in understanding the tool's purpose and benefits.

4. **Iterative Feedback:**
   - After each tool selection, update the gap analysis and adjust tool suggestions accordingly, ensuring that users receive real-time feedback on their choices.

5. **Final Output Clarity:**
   - Ensure that the generated textual diagram is well-organized, making it easy for clients to review their current toolset, understand covered activities, and recognize areas needing improvement.
